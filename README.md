# Gutenberg library project developed in angular by using APIs exposed by Gutenberg

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

## Project Overview
The project is simply re-imagined the already available Project Gutenberg - `https://www.gutenberg.org/`.
Here, I have used my knowledge of Angular to develop a version which is more easy to navigate and accomplishes the objective, i.e. to read and search books from the library.
The user can choose the genre of books he is intrested in and can then either search a specific book using the search bar provided. Alternatively, he can explore all the books available as he progresses.
An infinite scroll feature is added on top of the existing functionality to assist the user in loading more books easily.

## How to run the project

1. Download and install Node.js from : `https://nodejs.dev/en/download/`
2. Clone the repo and navigate inside the folder.
3. Execute the command: `npm install @angular/cli@8.3.3` (Not installing globally to avoid version conflicts)
4. Run `ng serve` inside the GutenbergProject folder
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
